## System requirements and installation
Whether you're running locally or in the cloud, you'll need to install:
1. Ubuntu 22.04 or Window 11(ROS2 Humble are not supported)
2. Nvidia Isaac Sim 5.0.0
3. Nvidia Isaac Lab 2.2.1
4. Ros2 Humble

Full instruction:
```
After installation of Nvidia Isaac Sim 5.0.0 and Ros2 Humble:

1. Clone this specific IsaacLab repo version: https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab/releases/tag/v2.2.1
2. Execute in ubuntu terminal:
export ISAACSIM_PATH="${HOME}/.local/share/ov/pkg/isaac-sim-5.0.0"
export ISAACSIM_PYTHON_EXE="${ISAACSIM_PATH}/python.sh"
and also put it inside .bashrc file
3. Inside the root folder of Isaac Lab repo (https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab/releases/tag/v2.2.1) execute ln -s ${ISAACSIM_PATH} _isaac_sim
4. Execute ./isaaclab.sh --conda
5. Execute conda activate env_isaaclab
6. Execute sudo apt install cmake build-essential
7. Execute ./isaaclab.sh --install
8. Verify the installation using "python source/standalone/tutorials/00_sim/create_empty.py" You should be inside conda env.
9. You need to check that you have "Isaac Sim Python 2023.1.1 - New Stage*" on the top of the window.
10. Clone this repo with git clone https://github.com/abizovnuralem/go2_omniverse/ --recurse-submodules -j8 --depth=1
11. Copy the config file Unitree_L1.json (located in go2_omniverse/Isaac_sim/Unitree/Unitree_L1.json) for the Unitree L1 LiDAR to the folder IsaacLab-0.3.1/source/data/sensors/lidar/Unitree_L1.json (if the path doesnt exists, create it)
12. Copy all material files in the isaac-sim-2023.1.1/data/material_files folder to IsaacLab_v0.3.1/source/data/material_files (if the path doesnt exists, create it)
13. Execute ./run_sim.sh (without activated conda env_isaaclab)
```

Some suggestions:
1. You need to check nvidia-smi, it should work, before installing Isaac Sim
2. You need to install Miniconda and execute: conda config --set auto_activate_base false
3. Install Omniverse launcher and then install Isaac Sim.
4. You need to install ROS2 on your system and configure it:

```
https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/installation/install_ros.html#isaac-sim-app-install-ros
```

## Usage
The current project was tested on Windows 11, IsaacSim 5.0.0 with IsaacLab 2.2.1 and Nvidia Driver Version: 577.
To start the project with Unitree GO2, execute:

```
./run_sim.sh
```

In Windows
```
run_sim.bat
```
To start the project with Unitree G1, execute:

```
./run_sim_g1.sh
```

In Windows
```
run_sim.bat --robot g1
```

You can control the dog using "WASD" keyboard commands

## ROS2 SDK

You can use https://github.com/abizovnuralem/go2_ros2_sdk as a basement for your ROS2 setup.


## Select custom env

To use predifined custom envs, you need to download files from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vVGuO1KIX1K6mD6mBHDZGm9nk2vaRyj3?usp=sharing and place them to /envs folder.
Then you can execute it modifying run_sim.sh script with --custom_env=office and --terrain flat commands. If you are doing it first time, it will take 2-3 minutes to configure the env. Please, wait.


## Development

To contribute or modify the project, refer to these resources for implementing additional features or improving the existing codebase. PRs are welcome!

## VR support (Not yet tested in ported version.)

To enable VR support on linux will take some time, but it works!
I have tested it on:
1. Ubuntu 22.04
2. Nvidia drivers are 545.29.06 
3. SteamVR 2.4.4 (IMPORTANT! It should be 2.4.4) and you need to go to Compatibility tab (Inside Steam app) and "Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool" and switch to "Steam-Play-None", additional info you can find in ALVR github issues tab.
4. ALVR streamer 20.8.1 + Oculus Quest 2 (client ALVR you can install via SideQuest app) (How to install it: https://github.com/alvr-org/ALVR)
5. Execute IsaacSim, Go to Window -> Extensions, find STEAMVR INPUT/OUTPUT then enable it and enable AutoLoad. Reopen IsaacSim. Use OpenXR mode.
6. Enjoy Omniverse in VR mode!


## Troubleshooting:

### The version of Isaac Simulator 2023.1.1 is no longer available on Omniverse Launcher, what should I do? 

1. Go to [Container Installation](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/installation/install_container.html) and follow all the steps in the **Container Deployment** section up to step 5).
2. Modify the command in step 6) with: 
```bash
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/isaac-sim:2023.1.1
```
3. Now run this command: 
```bash
docker run --name isaac-sim --entrypoint bash -it --runtime=nvidia --gpus all -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" --rm --network=host \
    -e "PRIVACY_CONSENT=Y" \
    -v ~/docker/isaac-sim/cache/kit:/isaac-sim/kit/cache:rw \
    -v ~/docker/isaac-sim/cache/ov:/root/.cache/ov:rw \
    -v ~/docker/isaac-sim/cache/pip:/root/.cache/pip:rw \
    -v ~/docker/isaac-sim/cache/glcache:/root/.cache/nvidia/GLCache:rw \
    -v ~/docker/isaac-sim/cache/computecache:/root/.nv/ComputeCache:rw \
    -v ~/docker/isaac-sim/logs:/root/.nvidia-omniverse/logs:rw \
    -v ~/docker/isaac-sim/data:/root/.local/share/ov/data:rw \
    -v ~/docker/isaac-sim/documents:/root/Documents:rw \
    nvcr.io/nvidia/isaac-sim:2023.1.1
```
4. Open another terminal and run the command ```bash docker ps``` to find the container's ID.
5. From the terminal inside the container, run this command to copy the entire Isaac 2023.1.1 folder to a folder on your computer (*I suggest naming it isaac-sim-2023.1.1 so that the setup commands above work*):
```bash
docker cp <id_container>:isaac-sim/. <your_local_machine_folder> # absolute path
```
6. On your PC, you will have a folder named **isaac-sim-2023.1.1**. Move it to the following path:
```bash
.local/share/ov/pkg/
```

### Could not import 'rosidl_typesupport_c' for package 'go2_interfaces'

If running ```./run_sim.sh``` results in the error **"Could not import 'rosidl_typesupport_c' for package"**, refer to this [thread](https://github.com/ros2/examples/issues/303).
